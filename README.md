Idaho Fish and Game Wildlife Management Area Interactive Map - V2

Thirty-two Wildlife Management Areas located in seven Fish and Game regions have been established to protect wildlife habitat and are available for hunting, fishing and other public enjoyment of wildlife. Varying from 275 to 85,000 acres, each area is dedicated to primary purposes such as big game, waterfowl and upland game.

This map was created through a combination of ArcGIS Online, ArcServer, and an Esri story map template.

Started with playlist-storytelling-template-js. "A storytelling template that organizes point data sets from a CSV file embedded in your web map into an organized interactive list.' This code was further customized to give it the IDFG look and feel and to add more functionality, such as the basemap picker.

The application is responsive and can be used on any platform - desktop, tablet, or mobile and is available through the IDFG website at: http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/ifwis/maps/wma/.
